# AWS Project: Architect and Build an End-to-End AWS Web Application from Scratch

## 🚀 Overview
This project focuses on designing and deploying a fully functional web application using AWS services. The goal is to create a **scalable, secure, and highly available** architecture by leveraging AWS best practices.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Deploy a web application with **frontend, backend, and database** components.
- Ensure **high availability and fault tolerance** using AWS services.
- Implement security best practices including **IAM roles, security groups, and encryption**.

## 🔧 AWS Services Used
- **EC2** – Virtual machines for hosting the backend.
- **RDS** – Managed relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
- **S3** – Static content storage for frontend hosting.
- **CloudFront** – Content delivery network (CDN) for faster access.
- **Route 53** – Domain name system (DNS) management.
- **IAM** – Identity and Access Management for security.
- **VPC** – Virtual Private Cloud for networking and security.
- **Auto Scaling** – Automatically scales EC2 instances.
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** – Distributes incoming traffic.

## 🏗 Architecture
1. **Frontend:** Hosted on Amazon S3 and delivered via CloudFront.
2. **Backend:** Deployed on EC2 instances inside an Auto Scaling group.
3. **Database:** Managed MySQL/PostgreSQL database using Amazon RDS.
4. **Networking:** Private subnets for backend security, public subnets for frontend.
5. **Security:** IAM roles, security groups, and SSL certificates for encryption.

## 📌 Implementation Steps
1. **Set up an EC2 instance** and deploy the backend application.
2. **Create an RDS instance** to store application data.
3. **Deploy frontend on S3** and configure CloudFront for global delivery.
4. **Set up a VPC** to define networking rules and security.
5. **Configure an Application Load Balancer** to distribute traffic to backend servers.
6. **Set up Auto Scaling** for handling increased traffic loads.
7. **Secure the application** with IAM roles, security groups, and SSL encryption.

## 🎯 Expected Learning Outcomes
- Gain hands-on experience with AWS **networking, compute, and database** services.
- Learn how to design **highly available and fault-tolerant** architectures.
- Understand best practices in **security, scalability, and automation**.

## 📢 Next Steps
Once you complete this project, move on to integrating DevOps principles using **CI/CD pipelines** with AWS CodePipeline and GitHub Actions.
