# **AWS Project: Serverless Web Application on AWS**
## 🚀 Overview
This project focuses on designing and deploying a fully functional **serverless** web application using **AWS Amplify, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and IAM**. The goal is to create a **scalable, secure, and cost-efficient** architecture by leveraging AWS best practices.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Deploy a **serverless** web application with a **frontend, backend, and database**.
- Ensure **high availability and fault tolerance** using AWS-managed services.
- Implement security best practices including **IAM roles, access control, and encryption**.

## 🔧 AWS Services Used
- **AWS Amplify** – Manages frontend deployment and hosting.
- **AWS Lambda** – Serverless compute for backend logic.
- **Amazon API Gateway** – Exposes REST/GraphQL APIs to interact with Lambda.
- **Amazon DynamoDB** – NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Amazon IAM** – Manages authentication, authorization, and security.

## 🏗 Architecture
1. **Frontend:** Deployed on AWS Amplify for seamless hosting and CI/CD.
2. **Backend:** AWS Lambda functions process API requests.
3. **Database:** Amazon DynamoDB stores application data in a NoSQL format.
4. **API Management:** Amazon API Gateway routes client requests to Lambda.
5. **Security:** IAM roles, API Gateway authentication, and Amplify Auth for user management.

## 📌 Implementation Steps
1. **Set up AWS Amplify** for frontend hosting and CI/CD integration.
2. **Deploy AWS Lambda functions** to handle backend logic.
3. **Configure API Gateway** to expose Lambda functions as APIs.
4. **Create a DynamoDB table** for data storage.
5. **Secure the application** with IAM roles and API Gateway authentication.

## 🎯 Expected Learning Outcomes
- Gain hands-on experience with **serverless computing** and AWS **managed services**.
- Learn how to design **highly available, scalable, and event-driven** architectures.
- Understand best practices in **IAM security, API authentication, and cost optimization**.

## 📢 Next Steps
Once you complete this project, move on to integrating **GraphQL APIs with AWS AppSync** and adding **Cognito for authentication**.
